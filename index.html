    <h3>Rules:</h3>
    <div><ol>
    <li>This game will be played over the course of many days.</li>
    <li>In order to win, you must eliminate the target assigned to you.</li>
    <li>Each of you will be assigned an Assassin number that you are to relinguish to your killer in the event that you are slayed. </li>
    <li>In order to kill someone, you must slice from shoulder to shoulder (ON THE BACK!) with a plastic spoon obtained from any of the dining halls. <br/>
     (There will be some left in the XLounge as well for those who can't frequent the dining halls) </li>
     <li>Once you've finished off your target, report their code to jea2161@columbia.edu with subject "Kill Code"for your next target.</li>
    <li>There are designated Safe Spaces below that killing is not allowed.</li>
    <li>In the event that a discrepancy arises, please contact jea2161@columbia.edu with the subject "Kill Confusion" to be resolve the situation. </li>
    <li>You can not kill your subject if they're in the midst of eating.</li>
    <li>Please exercise rational judgement in your practices. (Don't be wild)</li>
    <li>If no one has made a kill within 48 hours, a state of anarchy will be instated. </li>
    <li>In the state of anarchy, all assassins are free to kill anyone else who remains in the game. </li>
    <li>
    </ol>
